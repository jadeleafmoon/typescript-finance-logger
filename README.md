# Goal
The purpose of this project was to learn how to use TypeScript and get familiar with concepts like implicit vs explicit types, union types, objects, classes, interfaces, aliases, generics, tuples, and so on. 

# Why Use TypeScript?
The power of TypeScript over JavaScript is that it enables static typing. This feature enables developers to catch errors early, improve code maintainability, and facilitate better tooling and editor support. It helps to make large-scale projects more robust and reliable by enforcing type checks and enabling easier code refactoring.

# Installation
First, clone this repo onto your computer.

Make sure to install TypeScript. This command will install it globally on your machine.

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Install the required packages.
```
npm install
```

You can type your code in any of the `.ts` files, such as `app.ts`.

When ready, compile your TypeScript files into JavaScript files by typing the following in the terminal while in the root folder of the project:
```
tsc
```
